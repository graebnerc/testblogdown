<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>During this course we will use the following software and services:</p>
<ul>
<li>R</li>
<li>R-Studio</li>
<li>Git</li>
<li>Github</li>
<li>Netlify</li>
</ul>
<p>You will need to install the software and register for these services on
your own. While we will use one session in the second week for joint
troubleshooting, it is absolutely necessary that you do your best to install
the software on your own before that date.
To this end, this document is meant to provide you with all the information
needed. If you have questions, <em>please use the Moodle forum</em>. It is very
unlikely that you are the only person having a particular problem. Maybe
others can already help you out, and if not all should benefit from the
solution we find for your problem together.</p>

<div id="an-overview-over-the-apps-and-services-we-will-be-using---and-why" class="section level1">
<h1>An overview over the apps and services we will be using - and why</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>
is the programming language we are using. Installing <code>R</code> basically gives
your computer the ability to understand commands you will give to it using the
language R.
<a href="https://rstudio.github.io/">R-Studio</a>
is an application that facilitates the development of R-Studio.
It is a so called <em>Integrated Development Environment</em> (IDE). You may think of
it as a fancy editor, which not only allows you to write programs in R using
a more elaborated text editor, but simultaneously lets you preview the
graphs you are designing or the reports you are writing. Because R-Studio
facilitates the use of R, it is important to install R first, and then install
R-Studio.</p>
<p><a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>
is a so called <em>version control system</em> (VCS). It allows you to keep track
of different versions of your scripts without saving them under different
names. In other words, if you use Git, you can dispense of saving <code>Script-v1.R</code>,
<code>Script-v2.R</code> and <code>Script-v3.R</code>, but instead only keep <code>Script.R</code> and save the
different versions in the background, together with some comments about what
you have changed. Moreover, it facilitates the joint work on the same
document, something that is tremendously helpful for group works.
While we will not learn how to use Git (I will provide some optional tutorials,
though), it is important to install it since many user-written features of R
are distributed in a way that relies on Git.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>
can be thought of as a server for Git. R is an open source programming
language with a very active community. Many people are constantly developing new
features for R. For instance, if a new prediction algorithm get developed,
some people will soon write a so called <a href="https://r-pkgs.org/">R-package</a>
that implements this
algorithm in R. Then you as an R user can download this package and use the new
algorithm. This way, R is unlikely to ever VERALTEN. Sine most developers use
Git when developing the packages, they often distribute the programs in a way
that aligns well with the use of Git. And the most prominent way is Github.
Thus, you can see the source code for almost all R packages you will be using
on Github. Github is free, and all you need is to register!</p>
<p>The final service we will be using is <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>.
It is an easy way to publish
reports and host small websites. We will use it such that you can create
reproducible reports and present them in a visually appealing way. Given the
ease of use it is a great tool if you want to polish your results up visually
and send them to friends or colleagues who might not even use R themselves.</p>

<div id="installation-guidelines" class="section level1">
<h1>Installation guidelines</h1>
<p>The information in this tutorial is provided for Mac OS, Windows, and Linux.
Given the variety of different Linux distributions the comments on
the latter are rather short. There are, however, plenty explanations to be
found on the web for the different Linux distributions.</p>
<p>After you have completed the steps outlined below you are almost done: all
what remains is to install the R packages we require over the course of the
seminar. To this end, please consult the <a href="/tutorials/installation-packages/">respective Tutorial</a>.</p>
<div id="install-r" class="section level2">
<h2>Install R</h2>
<p>The installation of <code>R</code> is very similar across operating systems (OS).
The easiest
way is to visit the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R Homepage</a> and too download
the most recent version for your OS.
In case you are using Mac OS and want to use Homebrew, its best to use
<a href="https://github.com/sethrfore/homebrew-r-srf">this formula</a>.</p>
<p>In case R is already installed on your computer you should make sure that your
version is more of less up to date. For our seminar you should use at least R
version <code>R 4.0.4</code>. The version you are currently using is shown as soon as you
start <code>R</code>.</p>
<div id="macos-users" class="section level3">
<h3>MacOS users</h3>
<p>For <strong>MacOS users</strong>, the easiest route to update <code>R</code> is to just re-install the
most current version from the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R Homepage</a>.
Keep in mind that in this case you might need to re-install all previously
installed packages. If you have a lot of packages installed that you want to
keep, the following steps facilitates the re-installation process.
First, save a list with all the packages you installed yourself. To this end
type the following into the R console:<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<pre class="r"><code>package_overview &lt;- installed.packages()
package_names &lt;- as.vector(
  package_overview[is.na(package_overview[,&quot;Priority&quot;]), 1])
save(package_names, file=&quot;r_packages.rda&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>After re-installing R, you then need to load the file you previously saved
and identify the missing packages. You can use the following code to do so
if you are in the working directory in which you saved the file
<code>"r_packages.rda"</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>load(&quot;r_packages.rda&quot;)
packages_new &lt;- installed.packages()
packages_new_ &lt;- as.vector(packages_new[is.na(packages_new[,&quot;Priority&quot;]), 1])
missing_packages &lt;- setdiff(package_names, packages_new_)
install.packages(missing_packages)
update.packages()</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="windows-users" class="section level3">
<h3>Windows users</h3>
<p><strong>Windows users</strong> have a slightly more convenient route available to them: the
<a href="https://github.com/talgalili/installr">installr package</a>.
It does not require you to re-install your packages.
Just type the following code into your R console:<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;installr&quot;)
ibrary(installr)
updateR(TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>For more information see
<a href="https://github.com/talgalili/installr">the package website</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="linux-users" class="section level3">
<h3>Linux users</h3>
<p>Linux users simply install <code>R</code> via their package manager. A quick search on
Google should provide you with the information that are relevant for your
particular Linux distribution.
Updating is usually
straightforward as well: just run the respective command from your package
manager.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="r-studio" class="section level2">
<h2>R-Studio</h2>
<p>Installing R-Studio is easy. The only thing you should keep in mind that
you should <strong>install R first</strong>, and <strong>R-Studio second</strong>.
So, after installing <code>R</code> got to the
<a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/">R-Studio download page</a>
and download the <em>RStudio Desktop</em> version for your OS according to the
installation instructions provided.</p>
<p>If you are on Mac and you are using Homebrew you may use
<a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/rstudio">this formula</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="git" class="section level2">
<h2>Git</h2>
<p>Installing Git is straightforward, but the right approach depends on your OS.</p>
<div id="macos" class="section level3">
<h3>MacOS</h3>
<p>On <strong>MacOS</strong> you should install Git as part of the Command Line Developer
Tools, which themselfes are part of XCode (Caution: these are large!).
Its easiest to run the following
command from your Terminal:<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<pre><code>git --version</code></pre>
<p>If you get an output such as <code>git version 2.34.1</code> you already installed you
need. If not, you
will be asked to install the respective software packages (which can be large,
so make sure you have a good internet connection).</p>
</div>
<div id="windows" class="section level3">
<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>On <strong>Windows</strong> you download <code>Git for Windows</code> from the
<a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win">official Webpage</a>, which also provides you
with all the relevant instructions.</p>
</div>
<div id="linux" class="section level3">
<h3>Linux</h3>
<p>On <strong>Linux</strong> use you package manager. In most cases the name of the relevant
package is <code>git-all</code>, so on Ubunto, for instance, you would install Git
via <code>sudo apt install git-all</code>.</p>
</div>

<div id="register-for-the-necessary-services" class="section level1">
<h1>Register for the necessary services</h1>
<div id="github" class="section level2">
<h2>Github</h2>
<p>This is easy. Just visit <a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a> and
sign up using your email account.</p>
</div>
<div id="netlify" class="section level2">
<h2>Netlify</h2>
<p>This is easy as well. Visit <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">https://www.netlify.com/</a>
and click on <code>Sign up</code> in the upper right of the webpage.
You can now either create a Netlify account by clicking on <code>Email</code> and
register a new email addresss, or you can link Netlify to one of the other
accounts you might already have. I personally, for instance, linked
Netlify to my Github account.</p>
